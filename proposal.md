## Title of your project

## Team members

## Project goals
Our project is to create a Simon Says memory game using Mango Pi. The game will have two modes:

One-Player Mode: A progressively challenging sequence of LED lights that the player must mimic using buttons.
Two-Player Mode: A competitive mode where Player 1 creates a sequence, and Player 2 tries to repeat it.
End Goal:

Fully functional game with LED control, button input, scoring, and sound feedback.
A robust user interface with graphics for displaying scores and status.
A polished hardware design with a secure and visually appealing casing.
Stretch Goals:

Additional levels of difficulty, such as variable speed or complex patterns.
Themes for LEDs and sounds (e.g., festive or sci-fi themes).
Animations or visual effects for win/loss states.
Fallback Position:

Focus on delivering a polished single-player mode with scoring and sound integration if two-player mode proves challenging.

## Resources, budget
Materials Needed:

5 LEDs and corresponding resistors (already have from lab kits).
5 push buttons (already have from lab kits).
Buzzer or small speaker ($5).
Acrylic sheets or other material for casing ($10).
Extra wires or connectors for assembly ($5).
Budget:
We anticipate staying within the $20/person reimbursement limit.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
For now working together, will divide as we go.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Week 1 (Now - Dec 6):

Hardware setup: LEDs and buttons functional.
Core game logic: Sequence generation and single-player scoring.
Test one-player mode without sound or graphics.
Week 2 (Dec 7 - Dec 10):

Add sound effects to enhance feedback.
Develop a graphics display for score tracking.
Build and test a basic casing.
Week 3 (Dec 11 - Dec 12):

Implement and test two-player mode.
Polish the hardware design and add animations or effects if time permits.
Conduct final testing and debugging.
Midpoint Goals (by Dec 6):

Functional one-player mode with basic scoring.
Hardware setup complete.
Random sequence generation tested.

## Additional resources, issues
Additional Resources:

Reference materials on GPIO interrupts and sound integration with Mango Pi.
Tutorials on designing simple casings for electronics projects.
Possible Risks:

Timing and synchronization issues with button presses and LED sequences.
Sound integration might take longer than expected.
Two-player mode logic and testing could be time-consuming.
How can we help?

Guidance on advanced debugging techniques for interrupts and timers.
Recommendations for materials to build a casing within the budget.
Assistance in sourcing components like a buzzer or speaker.
